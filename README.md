# Mindbase
An implementation of the information-base (infobase) concept, similar to a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database), but more intuitive and flexible for human interaction scenarios. 

# Infobase
Information-base is an organized collection of information, similar to a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database), that follows intuitive patterns of the mind in terms of its inner workings, as well as its interface with external systems and users. An infobase instance functions in similar ways as a person's mind, extended with additional memory and processing resources, in terms of understanding and communicating information. Thus, more intuitive applications and user experiences can be built on top of an infobase, and the costs of ramp-up, implementation and support by real people is reduced substancially.

Databases store and index data in document or relational formats, and can be queried using abstract expressions. However they often rely on the application layer to make sense of these data structures, and to map them to separate user interfaces for user interactions and service APIs for system interaction. Infobase instances on the other hand, store, process and "understand" information, following similar patterns as the human mind, and can therefore answer natural language questions.

For example, for a simple personal work item tracking scneario, a database store that information in relational or document-based format with fixed schema. Developers then build the application layer separately, and translate the set schemas in a way users understand in the UI. An infobase, on the other hand, would records the item tracking information in terms of all the events that have affected these items over time, similar to how a mind records events related to things, starting with their discovery. An infobase has enough information about discovery, events and relations between things, to "understand" (through learning, supervised or otherwise,) the moving parts of the said things and how they relate to other things. As a result, the infobase will be able to present an understandable user interface to users, as well as to systems.
