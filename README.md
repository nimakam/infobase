# Mindbase
An implementation of the information-base (infobase) concept, similar to a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database), but more intuitive and flexible for real world scenarios. 

# Infobase
Information-base is an organized collection of information, similar to a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database), that follows intuitive patterns of the mind, for its inner workings as well as its interface with external systems and users. An instance of infobase can be considered to function very similar to how one person's mind, with extended memory and processing resources, would understand and communicate information. As a result, more intuitive application user experiences can be built on top of it, and the cost of ramp-up, implementation and servicing by real people is reduced substancially.

Databases store and index data in document or relational formats, and can be queried using abstract expressions. However they often rely on the application layer to make sense of these data structures, and to map them to separate user interfaces for user interactions and service APIs for system interaction. In infobase on the other hand will store, process and "understand" the information it stores as a person would do in their mind, and can therefore answer natural language questions 

For example, for a simple personal work item tracking scneario, databases store that information in relational or document-based format.  The application would then be built separately and map those concepts to users. An infobase, on the other hand, records the information in terms of all the entities and events that have affected those entieies over time, similar to how a mind records events related to entities, starting with their discovery. An infobase has enough information to "understand" through learning, supervised or otherwise, the moving parts of these entities and how they relate to other entities. As a result, the infobase will be able to present a user interface for people, and to provide APIs for systems.
